        "### Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Defining a Distributed Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "A distributed training strategy was set up using tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(). This allowed the model to be trained across multiple GPUs (if available) by replicating the model across devices and synchronizing the gradients.\n",

        "#### 3. Model Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was built using TensorFlow's Sequential API.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CNN consists of two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the images. After flattening, a fully connected dense layer with 128 units is used, followed by an output layer with 10 units representing the 10 digit classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Training Process\n",
        "\n",
        "The model was trained both with and without the distributed MirroredStrategy to compare the performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Single-GPU Training: The model was trained without a distributed strategy using different batch sizes: 64, 128, and 256. Training time and accuracy were recorded for each batch size.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Multi-GPU Training with MirroredStrategy: The same model architecture was trained using MirroredStrategy with batch sizes 64, 128, and 256. Training time and test accuracy were recorded.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Training Metrics and Evaluation: The training time and test accuracy were compared between the single-GPU and multi-GPU approaches to assess the advantages of distributed training.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. Experiments and Observations\n",

        "\n",
        "Single-GPU vs Multi-GPU: Training using MirroredStrategy demonstrated faster training times as compared to the single-GPU setup, especially with larger batch sizes. This is due to the workload being distributed across multiple GPUs, reducing the training bottleneck.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batch Size Impact: Larger batch sizes led to faster training times, but in some cases, the test accuracy slightly decreased. This behavior highlights the trade-off between training speed and model generalization.\n"
